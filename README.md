Tumblr Boilerplate 0.1.1.1 beta
===========================

Forked from [Dave Santos](https://github.com/davesantos)

This is a fully constructed template to help speed up the development of Tumblr themes. The goal was to remove redundant tags and use the least amount code to maintain easy theme development.

Features 
--------

* HTML5
* Supports most post-types

__Does not support__

* Localization strings
* Group Blogs
* Following
* Likes
* Custom appearances

These were consciously not included to expedite the workflow, however if you wish to include them then feel free to fork.

Notes
-----

There are links to my personal hosting in this for css/js/fonts/images. If you wish to make changes to the styles then you will need to either upload them to your own hosting, or use the Tumblr file hosting services.
